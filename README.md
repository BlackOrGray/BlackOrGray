Hey there 🥳

I'm Dai — a Computer Engineering major who loves mixing electrical sparks ⚡ with coding magic 💻  
When I'm not debugging, I'm probably re‑debugging (because let's be honest, it never works the first time).

 About Me:
- Studying Computer Engineering (yes, I willingly signed up for both hardware and software headaches).
- Professional bug collector (a.k.a. programmer).

Fun Facts:

•	Wynncraft > Hypixel (fight me)
•	I love anime, it keeps me inspired, and sometimes I pretend my code has a dramatic plot twist
•	Oregairu is my favorite anime 😺


If you enjoy coding, anime, or pretending we understand recursion, you’re in the right place.
